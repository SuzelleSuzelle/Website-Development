        <h1>Food</h1>
        <p>
            Nutritionally, food is the foundation of life. It provides essential nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, fats,
            vitamins, and minerals that fuel your body, repair tissues, and support overall health. For example, carbohydrates are
            your body's primary energy source, while proteins are crucial for muscle repair and growth. Fats, often misunderstood,
            are vital for brain health and hormone production. Vitamins and minerals, though needed in smaller amounts, play a
            massive role in everything from immunity to bone strength.
